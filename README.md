# Over-The-Air-OTA-Security-Research
This research focuses on the security of OTA update mechanisms and carrier provisioning for SIM cards.
## Research Components

### Update Mechanisms
- [ ] Analyze OTA update authentication
- [ ] Test SMS-based OTA security
- [ ] Evaluate CAT_TP security
- [ ] Assess BIP (Bearer Independent Protocol) security

### Carrier Provisioning
- [ ] Test provisioning message integrity
- [ ] Analyze SMS C-Channel security
- [ ] Develop replay attack prevention strategies
- [ ] Evaluate OTA command authorization mechanisms

## Testing Methodology
1. OTA update security assessment procedure
2. SMS security testing for OTA commands
3. Provisioning message integrity verification
4. Replay attack simulation

## Tools Required
- OTA testing environment
- SMS simulation tools
- Protocol analyzers
- Custom testing scripts

## Expected Outcomes
- OTA security assessment report
- Identification of update vulnerabilities
